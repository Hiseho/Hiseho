It assumes little to no prior knowledge of linux or self-hosting but getting familiar with its basics will help you to get the most out of it.

"Self-hosting is the practice of running and maintaining a website or service using a private web server, instead of using a service outside of the administrator's own control." - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-hosting_(web_services)). Self-Hosting is a great way to either, take back control of your data, learn more about how the internet works or even save money by hosting your own services at little cost.

- A domain name (optional but ***HEAVILY*** recommended)
- Free time and a bit of patience !
