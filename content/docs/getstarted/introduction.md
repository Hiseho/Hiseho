Welcome to the self-hosted world!

This guide aims at helping you to understand the **self-hosted world** and how to get started with it !
It assumes little to no prior knowledge of linux or self-hosting but getting familiar with its basics will help you to get the most out of it.
Whether you're in for the privacy, the learning experience or the fun of it, self-hosting is a great way to get started with it.

## What is self-hosting?

"Self-hosting is the practice of running and maintaining a website or service using a private web server, instead of using a service outside of the administrator's own control." - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-hosting_(web_services)). Self-Hosting is a great way to either, take back control of your data, learn more about how the internet works or even save money by hosting your own services at little cost.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, you should not necessarily have a lot of knowledge about self-hosting but you should have at hand :
- A computer which will act as your server
- A domain name (optional but ***HEAVILY*** recommended)
- Free time and a bit of patience !
