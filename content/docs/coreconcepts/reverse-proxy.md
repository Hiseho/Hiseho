Reverse proxies are a service that takes requests and map them to the right service. Up until now, we have been talking about web servers but you might have noticed that a machine only has a limited number of ports, and you don't access this webpage specifying the port number in the URL. This is where reverse proxies play their magic.

## Prerequisites

To understand reverse proxies, you need to understand how web servers work. If you haven't already, you can read the [Web Servers](/docs/coreconcepts/web-server) page.
You should also read the [basic internet](/docs/coreconcepts/internet) concepts.
