Reverse proxies are a service that takes requests and map them to the right service. Up until now, we have been talking about web servers but you might have noticed that a machine only has a limited number of ports, and you don't access this webpage specifying the port number in the URL. This is where reverse proxies play their magic.

## Prerequisites

To understand reverse proxies, you need to know about the following concepts:
- [Web Servers](/docs/coreconcepts/web-server)
- [Internet](/docs/coreconcepts/internet)
- [Networking](/docs/coreconcepts/networking) is advised but not necessary if you have only one machine.
